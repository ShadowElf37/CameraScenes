High Priority Features
- scenes can set background image properly
- separate pid for audio and video - maybe establish flexible pid groups that can be set at will

High Priority Bugs
- after unmuting a muted client on Windows the mic throws "unanticipated host error" and dies gloriously

Low Priority Features
- debug labels on camera viewers - user uuid
- scenes can create sprites; Sprite should be animated, as in looping frames on draw(); need objects list that mainloop can draw, or maybe the scene gets a draw call
- Load scenes from JSON
- client-side video scaling (server is transforming fine but we can avoid it at least a bit)
- client-side cue indicators, like "you're coming up", notified via meta, for UI
- in channeller we could have keybound functions in config, easy HALT
- channeller gets programmable indicator lights? can show connected to externals
- mouse can move objects around and it prints out position - good for scene editing
- proper logging, log packets per second instead of every packet because that's a lot with 12 people
- UI scaling, maybe
- pleasant UI
- wipe transitions - cams get told to crop and reposition themselves as an x value increments, could be pretty easy to implement

Low Priority Bugs
- second person inconsistent join? may have something to do with frag - client isn't sending sometimes, possibly, may have fixed itself in solving other bugs
- very inconsistent experience on mac first launch ?  https://medium.com/@kassiaxy_60505/how-to-turn-camera-on-mac-os-x-b217274b6c8a
