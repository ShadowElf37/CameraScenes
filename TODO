High Priority Features
- TODO Scene class, controls camera size, location, on/off - based on USER uuid - should have access to session objects for emergencies
- TODO SceneManager class, controls scenes and cues

High Priority Bugs
- TODO no bueno, uuids are shared between foreign clients despite being on different systems
- TODO very inconsistent experience on mac first launch ?  https://medium.com/@kassiaxy_60505/how-to-turn-camera-on-mac-os-x-b217274b6c8a

Low Priority Features
- debug labels on camera viewers - user uuid
- scenes can set background
- scenes can create sprites; Sprite should be animated, as in looping frames on draw(); need objects list that mainloop can draw, or maybe the scene gets a draw call
- client-side video scaling (server is transforming fine but we can avoid it at least a bit), maybe client-side mutes too
- client-side cue indicators, like "you're coming up", notified via meta
- keep-alive and/or timed ping pong metas in the event we can silence clients; client/session dies after some time of no signal
- listener pipe/socket for cues, simple device that can be worked into Channeller - SceneManager processes cues and switches scenes, clients, etc.
- in channeller we could have keybound functions in config, easy HALT
- UI scaling
- pleasant UI

Low Priority Bugs
- client doesn't exit when the connection to server dies (i.e. server quits), is there a reliable way to determine this? (thread throws brokenpipe but doesnt exit)
