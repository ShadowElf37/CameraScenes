High Priority Features
- just specify folder for a sprite to pull 123456 from - it's annoying specifying all paths
- log packets per second instead of every packet because that's a lot with 12 people
- wipe transitions - cams get told to crop and reposition themselves as an x value increments, could be pretty easy to implement
    - or maybe, capture screen somehow and just crop that slowly
    - we can have a brief capture of the second screen and put that behind as we crop
