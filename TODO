High Priority Features
- debug labels on camera viewers - user uuid
- scenes can create sprites; Sprite should be animated, as in looping frames on draw(); need objects list that mainloop can draw, or maybe the scene gets a draw call
- text and other objects in scene JSON
- client-side cue indicators, like "you're coming up", notified via meta, for UI - general client UI is good
- channeller needs pipe device

High Priority Bugs
-

Low Priority Features
- client-side video scaling (server is transforming fine but offloading never hurts)
- proper logging; log packets per second instead of every packet because that's a lot with 12 people

Low Priority Bugs
- BasicTiler is quite broken, just move away from it
- very inconsistent webcam experience on mac first launch ?  https://medium.com/@kassiaxy_60505/how-to-turn-camera-on-mac-os-x-b217274b6c8a
- (temp fixed) after unmuting a muted client on Windows the mic throws "unanticipated host error" and dies gloriously

Extra Features
- in channeller we could have keybound functions in config, easy HALT
- channeller gets programmable indicator lights? can show connected to externals
- mouse can move objects around and it prints out position - good for scene editing
- UI scaling, maybe
- pleasant UI
- wipe transitions - cams get told to crop and reposition themselves as an x value increments, could be pretty easy to implement
