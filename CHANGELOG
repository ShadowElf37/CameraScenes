- Minor improvements

BETA v0.1.12 (LOGGING)
- Added file-logging to client so we can see output even as an executable
- Fixed macOS build process
- Added JSON5 support to server
- Mute-type commands can now take multiple arguments (i.e. mute multiple people)

BETA v0.1.11 (FADES)
- Server mutes before the client officially does, in case the mute message gets lost in the mail
- Added fade transitions
- Made the transition code more flexible
- Fixed scaling ONCE AGAIN - client is wflex while server crops, it's the only stable combination

BETA v0.1.10 (CROPPING)
- Added crop scaling option for large aspect ratios
- Added height-flexible scaling option and rebranded old flex as width-flexible
- Fixed yet another issue with the unscaled scaling option
- Canonized scaling options and added a variable to client that controlled whether they see their camera as we see it, or as the webcam sees it - maybe we can add a button to toggle this
- Improved setup.py compatibility

BETA v0.1.9 (RESIZABLE CLIENT)
- Fixed text vertical centering - it was off by one line every time
- Fixed a bug where if you went back two scenes through a wipe, the wipe would continue into the new scene, even if it had no wipe itself
- Client has a resizable window now
- Server window is no longer resizable

BETA v0.1.8 (BUILD)
- Proper setup.py that packages the application on any platform
- Fixed issues with getting the icon to exist in the executable

BETA v0.1.7 (BUGS)
- Fixed a bug that killed executables because pygame wanted the actual icon file
- Fixed a bug that killed clients when you switched a scene containing them if they weren't in the original scene they joined on

BETA v0.1.6 (ICON)
- Added icons to channeller and proscenium - credit to Benjamin Coveler
- Fixed bug where webcam viewers died after changing dimensions

BETA v0.1.5 (BUGS)
- Actually fixed the scale_to() function that was causing so many issues
- Fixed a bug where pipe-killing a client was NOT safe and other objects would try to access it
- Implemented intelligent and flexible resolution scaling for diverse aspect ratios - we currently match height, can implement crops if necessary

BETA v0.1.4 (SPRITE UPGRADE)
- Sprites can be programmed to move to a position, and die after moving, and loop their movements, and stuff
- Sprites can be rotated at the start
- Raised the bad webcam resolution error early so it doesn't blindside us
- Added event reporting to UDPManager so it prints intelligent information every once in a while instead of spam


======= MAJOR =======  [past this point, all planned minor features have been implemented]


ALPHA v0.1.3 (WIPES)
- Improved pipe
- Added directional wipe transitions and JSON for it
- Sprites now pull alphabetically from a specified folder in sprites/

ALPHA v0.1.2 (CLIENT UPGRADE)
- Added comms for changing client text and color
- Added pipe commands for changing client text and color, closing the server, and killing bad clients
- Offloaded resolution scaling to client - it still happens on server if the client is dumb and sends dogshit frames
- Fixed a bug that didn't exit the program when you closed the tk window in server main
- Fixed a bug that prevented clients from rejoining properly
- Fixed a bug where cams would go to the last scene's spots outside of debug mode

ALPHA v0.1.1 (EDIT MODE & SPRITES)
- Fraction-of-window camera xywh can now be used in JSON
- Pretty good Sprite class in graphics.py
- Added text and sprite init from JSON
- Added draggable cams and debug text with uuid@x,y to debug mode
- Fixed a bug where the tk setup windows wouldn't submit with <enter>

ALPHA v0.1.0 (SHOW JSON)
- Scenes are now loaded from JSON - these files hold scene initialization data
- Added shows folder for show JSON and test.json
- Added debug mode where missing feeds appear as white rects
- Added config.json for cached options - not useful for user at the moment
- Added show JSON selection menu, very similar to Channeller's
- Added Rect to graphics.py


======= MAJOR =======  [past this point, all vital features have been implemented]


ALPHA v0.0.10 (BACKGROUNDS)
- Scenes can set backgrounds - scales to window's original w/h
- PID groups are now created for every datatype on the fly through a defaultdict - frames assembled slowly will no longer get drowned out by audio, for example
- Moved client and server code to top folder to ease file structure
- Band-aid fix for a bug on Windows where PyAudio's start_stream() made the stream explode

ALPHA v0.0.9 (MUTES)
- Cleaned up redundant audio code
- Added UDP ping pong
- Server now kills feeds for clients that fail their ping pongs
- Added mute for Webcam and integrated all mutes with client main
- Added command system in SceneManager to handle pipe input
- Fixed a bug that caused Tcl to crash on macOS whenever the pygame window was unfocused and refocused (very weird bug)
- Minor improvements

ALPHA v0.0.8 (FRAGMENTATION)
- Fragmentation now works properly with multiple clients
- Fixed fragmentation bug
- Fixed client exit bug
- Fully removed permissions check in client main.py
- Cleaned up exit process for server and client; added more error protection

ALPHA v0.0.7 (PIPES)
- Added application-layer fragmentation; maybe we won't need sudo anymore?
- Added pipe.py
- Fixed many bugs, especially with the layouts

ALPHA v0.0.6 (SCENES)
- Added SceneManager, Scene, Layout
- Integrated the server mainloop and BasicTiler with the new Scene structure
- Fixed some bugs

ALPHA v0.0.5 (ERROR MESSAGES)
- Client has user-friendly error messages for many situations during startup
- Client loading screen now mirrors log output
- Clearer startup logging
- graphics.Text has rudimentary support for multiple lines; please don't use this seriously
- Cleaned up redundant code

ALPHA v0.0.4 (AUDIO & COMMS)
- UNIMPLEMENTED: G729A audio encoding support for all OS, G729ABufferedAudioInterface in audio.py; this may not get used now that audio broadcasting is undoable
- Server gets raw audio from clients and plays it
- Client now formally tells the server when it opens and closes, and the server manages video + audio outputs accordingly
- Client can now set a custom uuid at launch
- Client now dies when server dies
- Client is told to die if it's communicating with the server and the server has no record of it
- Added loading message to client
- Lots of bug fixes

ALPHA v0.0.3 (BASE)
- MAC address used for uuid, allowing devices to connect and disconnect without breaking the server's session with it
- Sessions are now stored by uuid - pid is the only thing verified
- Bug fixes

ALPHA v0.0.2 (BASE)
- Buffered send()
- Added scale_to() in webcam.py
- Added enforce_dim option to WebcamViewer so you don't have to manually rescale in mainloop
